Week 10 : Problem solving mini-capstone
=======================================

Outcome: Students will leverage upon the skills and knowledge picked up in this course to accomplish a mini-capstone project, focused on the process of solving problems with code. 

Intro
-----
Welcome to the end of this course! In many STEM degree programmes, students are required to do a capstone project in their last semester where they apply the concepts they've learnt. The terminology "capstone" refers to the the last block you put on a building in ancient times, symbolizing the final piece of the learning experience. 

This week, we will be doing something similar, except instead of having ten weeks to do a capstone, we will be do a mini-capstone. Choose one of the topics below to work on; we will have a brief show-and-tell at the end of the class. You are more than welcome to work on this material in advance of the class itself.
	* Mini-capstone 1: n-body simulation (physics)
	* Mini-capstone 2: 1D fluid simulation (cellular automata)
	* Mini-capstone 3: Ecosphere equilibrium (biology + optimization)

The best way to improve with coding is to work on your own project consistently. 

The second best way to improve is to learn from the resources out there on the internet. Regardless what you want to do with coding / how much time you want to spend on coding, good coders are those that spend time improving on their own. 

* Improving at algorithms:
	* `Leetcode, algorithmic coding challenges <https://leetcode.com/>`_
	* `Hackerrank, algorithmic coding challenges <https://www.hackerrank.com/>`_
* Learning bioinformatics:
	* `Rosalind, learn bioinformatics online through coding challenges <http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/>`_
* Learn machine learning:
	* `Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera, no need to pay for the cert, just audit the course <https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning>`_

If this is your thing, build your way up to tackle coding challenges:
