Week 7 : Numerical methods
==========================

Outcome: Students will be shown how code can be use to solve engineering problems via numerical methods. 

What we will do:
    * Setup check + Intro to numerical methods
	* Why do we need numerical methods?
	* Applications of numerical methods
	* Exercise: Solving roots using Newton-Raphson's method
	* Exercise: Euler's method to solve for movement of a spring


Setup check + Intro to numerical methods
----------------------------------------
.. Section objective: 
.. Estimated time: 10 mins
.. Instructor notes: This is more context setting than introduction. 

.. Setup check here
.. Need numpy and matplotlib

Setup check
^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Context setting here

What are numerical methods?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Why do we need numerical methods?
---------------------------------
.. Section objective: 
.. Estimated time: 10 mins
.. Instructor notes: 

.. Some problems cannot be solved analytically, or will take forever
.. Analytical form means can solve the equation
.. Numerical methods allow us to approximate them


Applications of numerical methods
---------------------------------
.. Section objective: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Instructor notes: 

.. List example applications here, mostly used in engineering or sciences
.. List small examples to big examples --> weather prediction is probably a big basket of numerical methods
.. Small example is Taylor series expansion, or FFT for signals


Exercise: Solving roots using Newton-Raphson's method
-----------------------------------------------------
.. Section objective: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Instructor notes: 

.. Need to dig up an engineering textbook for this


Exercise: Euler's method to solve for movement of a spring
----------------------------------------------------------
.. Section objective: 
.. Estimated time: 25 mins
.. Instructor notes: 

.. Need to draw a force diagram and derive equations for this
.. Plus an animated visualizer in matplotlib

Conclusion
----------
.. Estimated time: 5 mins
