Week 7 : Numerical methods
==========================

Outcome: Students will be shown how code can be use to solve engineering problems via numerical methods. 

What we will do:
    * Introduction to numerical methods
	* Exercise: Solving roots using Newton-Raphson's method
	* Exercise: Explicit integration scheme for movement of a spring
	* (Adv Exercise: Verlet integration scheme, show that energy conservation of the spring is obeyed)
