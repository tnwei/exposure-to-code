Week 3: If/else, Functions
==========================
Outcome: Students will continue to learn basic control flow structures, specifically `if`/`else` statements. Students will also learn how to package repeatable code in functions.

.. Instructor notes
.. Message: Functions are really powerful when it comes to solving problems. Not different from copy-pasting code, but ease of use! Remember that code is to make things faster and easier! Writing good code makes you a lot more effective than writing bad code!

What we will do:
  * If, else and elif
	* Functions
	* Exercise: Fizz buzz
  * Exercise: Morse code reader
    .. * (Adv Exercise: Morse code writer??)

If, else, and elif
------------------
.. Instructor notes:
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: Introduce students to the concepts of if, else and elif
.. [ ] How to do things depending on how things go? If and else! Evaluates True / False - Can use any conditional statement
.. [ ] Format of if-else (indent after colon, un-indent to signify end) - add some examples
.. [ ] Perform in-class exercise that leads to students realizing you can nest if-elses! Phrase a problem in word form and have them practice translating it into code.
.. [ ] Have students do exercise that would be great with elif, using only if-else. After experiencing the hassle, then students will be able to appreciate elif!
.. [ ] Show how above's repeated comparisons can be reduced by using elif

Functions
---------
.. Instructor notes:
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: Introduce students to the concepts of functions, and the value of abstraction
.. [ ] Get students to do hands-on example, where the same code chunk needs to be repeated multiple times to do something slightly different every time.
.. [ ] Solve the problem again but w/ functions. Demonstrate how simple it is to change things up on the fly through parameters.
.. [ ] Format of functions (def keyword, indentation) - small example to show what does the return keyword do
.. [ ] Little in-class exercise on what to phrase as inputs to function, and what to return
.. [ ] In-class exercise, phrase a problem in word form and have students build a function to solve it.
.. [ ] Expand the problem, and show that by breaking problems down into functions, things are much easier to handle! Perhaps this just show, not do.

Exercise: Fizz Buzz
-------------------
.. Instructor notes:
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: Introduce students to a classic programming problem that requires good understanding of if/else to solve, and put into practice combining applications of if/else and functions in the same exercise.
.. [ ] Fizz buzz problem statement
.. [ ] Fizz buzz instructor solution

Exercise: Morse code reader
-------------------------------
.. Instructor notes:
.. Estimated time: 30 mins
.. Section objective: Cement if/else and function concepts with an un-orthodox exercise!
.. [ ] Provide context: what is morse code? How does it work?
.. [ ] Problem statement: Given morse code, convert to alphabet.
.. [ ] Need to provide the conversion table and example, else everyone's format is going to be different! We should stick to using letters and spaces only.
.. [ ] Instructor solution for taking in alphabets and translating them into Morse code. String samples can only contain alphabets and spaces.
.. [ ] Instructor solution needed to check that the morse code reader from above works!!
.. [ ] Write next few emails for the course in Morse code (???)

Conclusion
----------
.. Instructor notes
.. Estimated time: <5 mins
.. Section objective: Recap and re-emphasize message
.. [ ] Recap and re-emphasize message of the day

.. Kept in reserve due to time constraints!
.. Exercise: Quadratic solver
.. --------------------------
.. Instructor notes:
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: Combine application of if-else and functions on a topic familiar for high schoolers
.. [ ] Problem description
.. [ ] Instructor solution on solving quadratic eqn. Takes a, b, c and outputs roots. Gotta try because not sure how the system deals w/ imaginary roots!
