Week 8 : Solving Partial Differential Equations & Modelling Populations
==============================

Outcome: Students will be shown how coding can be used to solve ordinary differential equations, in this case with applications in epidemiology and ecology. Spend a lot of time on explaining and teaching the concept. 

What we will do:
	* Exercise: SIR disease model (explain intervention translating into coeficients)
	* Exercise: Predator-prey relationship
    * (Adv Exercise: Combining both!)
