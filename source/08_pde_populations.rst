Week 8 : Solving Partial Differential Equations & Modelling Populations
=======================================================================

Outcome: Students will be shown how coding can be used to solve ordinary differential equations, in this case with applications in epidemiology and ecology. Spend a lot of time on explaining and teaching the concept. 

What we will do:
	* Setup check + Introduction to partial differential equations
	* Partial differential equations around us
	* Modelling populations: Partial differential equations in biology
	* Exercise: SIR disease model I
	* Exercise: SIR disease model II


Setup check + Introduction to partial differential equations
------------------------------------------------------------
.. Section objective: Self-explanatory
.. Estimated time: 10 mins
.. Instructor notes: 

.. [ ]Setup check
.. [ ]Introduction to PDEs
.. [ ]What are PDEs? Definition
.. [ ]Talk about material we have covered that were PDEs
.. [ ]Talk about PDEs being a large part of natural phenomena, represents anything with interdependencies
.. [ ]Talk about how we solve them due to complexity: numerical integration (remember last week's class?)

Partial differential equations around us
----------------------------------------
.. Section objective: Talk about examples of natural phenomena that can be described as PDEs. Go more into detail!
.. Estimated time: 10 mins
.. Instructor notes: 

.. [ ]Example ONE of PDEs being used to describe phenomena/processes in things around us
.. [ ]Example TWO of PDEs being used to describe phenomena/processes in things around used
.. [ ]Example THREE of PDEs being used to describe phenomena/processes in things around us

Modelling populations: Partial differential equations in biology
----------------------------------------------------------------
.. Section objective: 
.. Estimated time: 15 mins
.. Instructor notes: 

.. [ ]Talk about population dynamics being a prime example of PDEs applied in biology. Elaborate
.. [ ]?? More content here
.. [ ]Cite examples


Exercise: SIR disease model I
-----------------------------
.. Section objective: 
.. Estimated time: 25 mins
.. Instructor notes: 

.. [ ]Lecture on epidemiological modelling
.. [ ]Explain concepts of SIR model: compartments, transmission between them (equations) and how they are solved, meaning of various terms and constants etc
.. [ ]Explain scenario from zombie outbreak paper
.. [ ]Task them to create SIR model, and the plotting, and provide a few constants to test diff scenarios

Exercise: SIR disease model II
------------------------------
.. Section objective: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Instructor notes: Extension of previous, incorporating intervention

.. [ ]Change architecture to model intervention at halfway point, see what happens. Explore few scenarios
.. [ ]Change SIR to become SIS, find equilibrium point. Is the modelled disease controllable?
