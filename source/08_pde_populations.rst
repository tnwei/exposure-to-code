Week 8 : Solving Partial Differential Equations & Modelling Populations
=======================================================================

Outcome: Students will be shown how coding can be used to solve ordinary differential equations, in this case with applications in epidemiology and ecology. Spend a lot of time on explaining and teaching the concept. 

What we will do:]
	* Setup check + Introduction to partial differential equations
	* Partial differential equations around us
	* Modelling populations: Partial differential equations in biology
	* Exercise: SIR disease model I
	* Exercise: SIR disease model II
