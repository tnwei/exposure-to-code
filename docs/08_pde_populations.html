<h3>Introduction to differential equations<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-to-differential-equations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before we go into differential equations today, we’ll need to first go over the fundamental terms involved.</p>
<p>Given a function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y = f(x)\)</span>, we can take the derivative with respect to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)</span>. Finding the derivative is like finding the slope. With every movement in the variable, we see how the function changes. We call an equation that describes derivatives, a differential equation.</p>
<p>When the function contains multiple variables, we can measure the rate of change relative to multiple directions. We measure how the function changes with respect to each variable by holding all other variables constant. We use the partial derivative symbol instead of the typical <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{d}{dx}\)</span> to reflect this.</p>
<p>Example: Given <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x, y) = 3x^2 + 9xy + 9y^2\)</span>, the partial derivative with respect to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y\)</span> are as below:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\frac{{\partial}f(x, y)}{{\partial}x} = 6x + 9y + 9y^2\\\frac{{\partial}f(x, y)}{{\partial}y} = 3x^2 + 9x + 18y\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>Thus, a partial differential equation is an equation made up of partial derivative expressions. Conversely, if a differential equation does not contain any partial derivatives, we call it an ordinary differential equation. The distinction between both types are important in terms of how they can be solved, but we will leave it to you to go into that detail on your own.</p>
<p>Differential eqns reflect how quantities vary with respect to each other. Dynamic systems where interdependent processes exist are thus very suitable to be expressed as differential equations, especially natural phenomena.</p>
<p>Unless we are working with differential equations in a purely mathematical context, they are used to model interdependent processes that cannot be expressed in only one equation. Typically, we end up working with a system of differential equations. Due to the complexity, almost no application of differential equations are solved by hand, instead they are given to computers to be solved efficiently, just like what we covered in last week’s class.</p>

<h2>Differential equations around us<a class="headerlink" href="#differential-equations-around-us" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>Given that the complexities of dynamic systems, both natural and man-made, can be described  by differential equations:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Heat transfer via conduction is a phenomenon that depends on time and position. The rate of change of temperature of an object is proportional to how much warmer or cooler its surroundings are.</p></li>
<li><p>Fluid dynamics are described by multiple differential equations, relating pressure and flow under various circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p>Maxwell’s equations in electromagnetism are four differential equations that describe how electric fields and magnetic fields relate to each other over time.</p></li>
<li><p>Reaction kinetics in chemistry are governed by differential equations, where the rate of reactions depend on the concentration of reactants present</p></li>
<li><p>The Black-Scholes equation is a differential equation in economics, that allows modelling market dynamics for options trading, which gave rise to derivatives trading.</p></li>

<h2>Differential equations in life sciences<a class="headerlink" href="#differential-equations-in-life-sciences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="modelling-populations">
<h3>Modelling populations<a class="headerlink" href="#modelling-populations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The life sciences also contain dynamic systems where the rate of change is dependent on interacting quantities. The best example is population dynamics, where fundamental factors leading to population growth / decline are modelled and expressed as differential equations.</p>
<p>One of the simplest models for population growth is the exponential growth model. A population that has a higher birth rate than death rate is projected to grow exponentially, where the rate of change is proportional to the existing population size. This is described by the equation below:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\]</div>
<p>In reality, when populations reach a certain size, they will encounter resource limits, where the growth rate of the population will slow down. This limit is called the carrying capacity of the population’s environment. To reflect this effect, the logistic growth model is developed instead, which introduces an extra term that slows down population growth when near the carrying capacity <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(K\)</span>, as follows:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\frac{dN}{dt} = rN - \frac{rN^{2}}{K}\]</div>
<p>Population modelling becomes a lot more interesting when we start looking at more than one population. For example, the population of a prey species and predator species can potentially lead to interesting interactions. Under certain conditions, prey-predator relationships can demonstrate cyclic behaviour. An increase in predator population will cause overhunting, leading to the population of prey to decrease. As food availability decreases, the predator population drops as well. Now that predation pressure is less, the prey population thrives and the numbers rise again.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modelling-diseases">
<h3>Modelling diseases<a class="headerlink" href="#modelling-diseases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The spread of infectious diseases in populations can be modelled using mathematical models, under the field of epidemiology. The concept is quite simple; each person in the modelled population will progress through various stages in the disease. These epidemiological models are also called compartmental models.</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>The simplest model is the SIR model, where people progress from being susceptible (S), to being infected (I), to finally being removed (R). Thus, the population can be divided into various compartments, one for each of the classified stages. The transmission of individuals from compartment to compartment are described using differential equations that best reflect the transmission mechanism:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>S to I: Susceptible persons are infected by coming into contacted with already infected persons. Thus transmission of S to I is proportional to the headcounts of S * I.</p></li>
<li><p>I to R: Infected persons are removed from the simulation over time at an average rate. Thus transmission of I to R is proportional to the headcount of I.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Translated into differential equations, the SIR model can be expressed as following:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[ \begin{align}\begin{aligned}\frac{dS}{dt} = - {\beta}IS\\\frac{dI}{dt} = {\beta}IS - {\gamma}I\\\frac{dR}{dt} = {\gamma}I\end{aligned}\end{align} \]</div>
<p>Where S, I and R stand for the proportion of the population headcount in the respective compartments, and beta and gamma are constants that are specific to the modelled disease. In other words, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S + I + R = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>More complex terms are used when considering factors such as different distinct stages in the disease (e.g. incubation), population birth rates and death rates if the modelling timespan is on a multi-year scale, and also immigration and emigration if movement of persons are incorporated.</p>

<h2>Exercise: SIR disease model I<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-sir-disease-model-i" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In this exercise, we will implement the simple SIR model as described above. We will use Euler’s method to integrate the differential equations over time, and plot the results.</p>
<p>Euler’s method is basically <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(y_{n+1} = y_{n} + \frac{dy}{dx} * dt\)</span>.</p>
<p>1. First we will set up the timesteps. Set <cite>dt</cite> to 1, representing 1 day per timestep. Set <cite>niter</cite> to 60, representing model duration to be 60 days. Then, create the <cite>timesteps</cite> variable for visualization purposes later:</p>

<h2>Exercise: SIR disease model III<a class="headerlink" href="#exercise-sir-disease-model-iii" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Revert to the code used in SIR disease model I, i.e. remove the code introducing interventions. We assume that the disease being modelled has mutated, and now a certain percentage of individuals who have recovered from the disease will become susceptible to the disease again.</p>
