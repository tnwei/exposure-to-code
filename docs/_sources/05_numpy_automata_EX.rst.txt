Week 5: Advanced Exercises
==========================
Advanced exercises are designed for advanced learners that are ready to take on extra challenges. These exercises are made accessible to all after the class. Note that these exercises typically require more knowledge than what was presented in class.  

Adv Exercise: Conway's Game of Life
-----------------------------------
.. Instructor notes
.. [ ] Show what Conway's Game of Life looks like
.. [ ] Explain the rules
.. [ ] Find a way to package this such that students can legitimately complete this in a short period of time. Might need to pre-write the visualizer? Jake Vanderplas has sth awesome on this as usual: http://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/08/07/conways-game-of-life/


.. warning :: Training wheels off! The material in today's class is not enough to solve this problem.
