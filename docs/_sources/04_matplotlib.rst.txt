Week 4: Visualization with matplotlib
=====================================
	
Outcome: Students will learn how to make basic plots in Python using `matplotlib`, the de-facto standard for visualization.

.. Instructor notes
.. Message: This class is only focused on how to use matplotlib, no deeper message of the day to take home

What we will do: 
	* What is matplotlib? 
	* Basic plotting
	* Basic configuration
	* Combining plot elements
	* Exercise: Writing a visualizer we will use soon ...
    .. * (No Adv Exercise: no concept to explore here)

What is matplotlib? 
-------------------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 10 mins
