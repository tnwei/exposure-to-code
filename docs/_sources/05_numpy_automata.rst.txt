Week 5 : `Numpy` vectors & cellular automata
============================================

.. Instructor notes
.. Message: Numerical computing in Python can be handled through the `numpy` package. Cellular automata as an interesting example of emergent complexity arising from simple rules. 

Outcome: Students will learn the basics of using `numpy`, Python's numerical computing library for array calculations. Students will also be introduced to the concept of cellular automata, one of the many interesting concepts in computer science.

What we will do:
	* Introduction to `numpy`
    * 1D arrays in `numpy`
	* Exercise: 1D fluid simulation by cellular automata
	* (Adv Exercise: Conway's Game of Life)

TODO: End w/ emergence (images, example applications)
