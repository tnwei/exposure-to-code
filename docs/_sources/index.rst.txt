Welcome to Exposure to Code! 
============================

.. .. note::
   This short course is originally developed for high schoolers in PERMATApintar National Gifted Center in Feb 2020. 

We will be taking a whirlwind tour through the world of code using Python. After learning some basic coding concepts, we will be exploring hands-on various interesting things you can do with code, then wrapping up with a problem solving capstone. If you are new to coding, and are looking to learn about code the same way one would learn about dolphins in an aquatic park, keep reading! 

The objective of this course is to give you a sneak peek into what you can do with code, and have you walk away with some coding basics after we're done. We believe that short courses are not suitable for teaching solid fundamentals for coding. Rather, recognizing that coding ultimately is a skill that needs to be mastered on your own, we prefer spending the little time we have to get you really really interested so you will be motivated to continue learning on your own! 

Thus, we hope your experience with this course will be more like a zoo safari than a museum tour. The things we hope you will be doing during the course are as follows, in order of importance:
    * Reading up on interested material on your own
    * Experimenting with the code
    * Listening to the instructor :)
    * Taking notes

Have fun learning!
